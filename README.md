# QuizBoxes
This is the QuizBox project for Hampus and Stina's 30th birthday party.
Briefly, the idea is to develop and build some quiz boxes where it's required some sort
of puzzle for the box to output a 4 digit code that is then used for opening
the combination lock of the box.

## Different Boxes
- BombBox
- RandomBox
- BinaryBox
- MorseBox
- TimingBeltBox?
